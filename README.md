# HA Proxy Docker image based on Alpine Linux

simple and lightweight haproxy in three versions: 
* lightweight (just haproxy installed on alpine)
* haproxy-openrc (haproxy installed on alpine-openrc)
* haproxy-autoreload (haproxy-openrc which does a quick configuration validity check and then reloads haproxy)
